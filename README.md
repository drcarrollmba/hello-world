Github Guide project to familiarize myself with Github's use

I'm Don, hi!  I started learning Python about six months ago, after first learning and then trying to find a superior alternative to VBA.  I started concurrently learning Posgresql, and then realized that these two things could be brought together, and so started learning Django, and then came Java.  Now, I know a little bit about several pieces of the pie, and am planning to 'bring it all together' in 2021!
